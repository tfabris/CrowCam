# CrowCamCuepoints.sh - A Bash script to add motion cuepoints to a live stream.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Please see the accompanying file REAMDE.md for setup instructions. Web Link:
#        https://github.com/tfabris/CrowCam/blob/master/README.md
#
# The scripts in this project don't work "out of the box", they need some
# configuration. All details are found in README.md, so please look there
# and follow the instructions.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Workaround to allow exiting a Bash script from inside a function call. See
# this EmpegBBS post for details of how this works and why it's needed:
# https://empegbbs.com/ubbthreads.php/topics/371554
# Note: the functions which call these traps are in CrowCamHelperFunctions.sh
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set a trap to receive a TERM signal from a function, and execute the code
# block "exit 1", in the context of the top-level of this Bash script, as soon
# as it receives the TERM signal.
trap "exit 1" TERM

# Create an exported environment variable named "TOP_PID" and populate it with
# the PID of this top-level Bash script. Use "$$" to identify the top level
# PID of this script. The function will use "$TOP_PID" to identify which PID to
# send the TERM signal to, once a program exit is desired.
export TOP_PID=$$

# Retrieve recent event information from Synology API.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Work in progress. Attempt to retrieve the recent history of motion detection
# events from Synology. This is the first experiment to see if I can query
# this at all? This does not work yet. Link to docs:
# https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Software/DeveloperGuide/Package/SurveillanceStation/All/enu/Surveillance_Station_Web_API.pdf
# Example from docs:
# "2.3.21.8 ListHistory method"
# GET /webapi/entry.cgi?start=0&api="SYNO.SurveillanceStation.ActionRule"&limit=100&version="1"&method="ListHistory"
# This produces no results, so, not using this.

# Example from docs:
# "2.3.11.6 CountByCategory method"
# GET /webapi/entry.cgi?locked=0&version="4"&blIncludeSnapshot=true&cameraIds=""&evtSrcType=2&reason=""&api="SYNO.SurveillanceStation.Recording"&evtSrcId=-1&toTime=0&limit=0&fromTime=0&method="CountByCategory"&timezoneOffset=480&includeAllCam=true
#
# Note: Not that many parameters are needed. The code below, using fewer
# parameters than the example, produces the total count of events that
# occurred on each date, with the breakdown of how many occurred in the AM and
# the PM of each date, as well as the total for the queried time range.
#
# {
#   "data":{
#     "date":{
#       "-1":53,
#                (... other entries omitted here ...)
#       "2020/05/03":{
#         "-1":8,
#         "am":4,
#         "pm":4
#       }
#     },
#     "evt_cam":{
#       "0":{
#         "-1":53,
#         "2-CrowCam":53
#       },
#       "-1":53
#     },
#     "recCntTmstmp":47375347270,
#     "total":53
#   },
#   "success":true
# }

# Create a query to see how many events occurred in the last X time period.
# Set a time range that is X seconds ago (300 = 5 minutes ago for example).
howLongAgoInSeconds=9600
toTime=$( date +%s )
fromTime=$(( $toTime -  $howLongAgoInSeconds))

# Get current system's timezone offset from Zulu based on current system
# timezone config. Lower case "%z" returns a value that looks like "-0700"
# (for PDT, which is my example).
timzoneZuluOffset=$( date +%z )

# Convert that into minutes of timezone offset from UTC, because the Synology
# API expects the "timezoneOffset" variable to be in minutes. First step is to
# get this into decimal hours using this great technique:
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/434133
timezoneOffsetHours=$( date +%z | sed -E 's/^([+-])(..)(..)/scale=2;0\1(\2 + \3\/60)/' | bc )
timezoneOffset=$( echo "$timezoneOffsetHours * 60" | bc )
LogMessage "dbg" "Current system timezone offset: ZuluCode: $timzoneZuluOffset  - Hours: $timezoneOffsetHours  - Minutes: $timezoneOffset"

# Perform the API query to look for events in that time range with that time offset.
eventCount=$( WebApiCall "entry.cgi?api=SYNO.SurveillanceStation.Recording&version=4&method=CountByCategory&limit=100&locked=0&timezoneOffset=$timezoneOffset&fromTime=$fromTime&toTime=$toTime" )

# Parse the count of "total": out of that output:
totalRecentEvents=""
totalRecentEvents=$(echo $eventCount | sed 's/"total"/\'$'\n&/g' | grep -m 1 "total" | cut -d ':' -f2 | cut -d '}' -f1)
LogMessage "dbg" "totalRecentEvents: $totalRecentEvents"

# Currently the above experimental code does not produce the results that I
# want. The query works, and if I make the time range large enough, it
# produces a nonzero count of events. However querying recent motion events
# (in the last few minutes) produces a "0" result even if something happened
# within the last couple of minutes. This is both with, and without, the
# timezoneOffset parameter being included. To do: get to the bottom of this.

# Debugging - Quit early while I am doing experiments with the APIs.
