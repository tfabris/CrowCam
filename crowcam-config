# This value points to the parent YouTube live stream that these scripts are
# controlling. It must be the live stream's main parent URL, not the address
# of an individual video within the channel. For instance, it must not be an
# archived video, or a link to a particular day's live stream. You can tell
# whether it is the correct link by looking at the the style of the URL. The
# correct value is https://www.youtube.com/channel/(Your_Channel_ID)/live.
#
#   Right:    https://www.youtube.com/channel/xyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyz/live
#   Wrong:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyzxyzxyzxyz
#
# This value is used when checking if the stream is working, and it is used
# when ensuring that the stream's DVR functionality stays working.
#
# Update this value to point to your channel's live stream.
#
youTubeUrl="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqPZGFtBau8rm7wnScxdA3g/live"


# Title of videos within the stream, to clean up at regular intervals. Only
# videos in the "My Uploads" section of the stream, with titles which match
# this string exactly, will be deleted.
#
# Note: Will also be used for checking that it's OK to work with the stream
# key of this stream name, as part of the fix for GitHub issue #27.
#
# Update this value to be the exact same title as your live stream.
#
titleToDelete="CrowCam"

# Title of the playlist which holds the live video archives, which you want to
# be periodically cleaned out of old videos. Can be "uploads" if desired
# ("uploads" is the internal code name for the default "My Videos" playlist),
# but it can also be a custom user-created playlist name, if you've configured
# your videos to be automatically added to a particular playlist.
#
# Update this value to be either "uploads" or the name the playlist where you
# want to clean out old videos named $titleToDelete.
# 
playlistToClean="CrowCam Archives"

# The number of days in the past that we will let old videos live before
# cleaning them up. For example, if this number is 5, and a video named
# $titleToDelete was made 4 days ago, it will not be deleted, but a
# $titleToDelete video made 5 days ago will be deleted.
#
# Set this to the number of days you wish to keep old videos before deletion.
#
dateBufferDays=9


# Desired visibility/privacy of the live stream. Most live streams are set to
# public, but you may have reasons for wanting to keep it unlisted or private.
# Because YouTube intermittently glitches and clobbers this value, the script
# will attempt to maintain this and keep it at the correct setting. Valid
# values are "private", "public", or "unlisted", case-sensitive.
#
# Set this to the desired visibility/privacy of this video stream, either 
# "private", "public", or "unlisted".
#
desiredStreamVisibility="public"


# Control whether or not to turn the YouTube stream on at sunrise and off at
# sunset. This is in response to GitHub issue #65.
# 
# Set sunriseSunsetControl to true if you wish for the camera to turn on at
# sunrise and off at sunset. Set it to false if you want the camera to run all
# the time.
#
# Important note: If you set this to "false", then you must manually turn your
# stream on and off yourself, by toggling the "Live: On" button in the
# Surveillance Station, in the "Live Broadcast" feature screen.
#
# Recommended value: true
sunriseSunsetControl=true


# Camera location for using in a Google Search. Can be a zip code, a city name,
# or something else which might result in a Google search that returns the
# correct sunrise or sunset time. Special bonus: If you leave the location
# blank (""), Google will just search on the word "Sunrise" or "Sunset" and
# automatically attempt to determine your location, based on where the query is
# originating from. Maybe this will work for your particular situation, feel
# free to experiment with leaving it blank. The code simply performs a Google
# search with a search string where the word "Sunrise" or "Sunset" precedes
# this location string. Examples: 
#   location="98125"        Google search will be "Sunrise 98125" etc.
#   location="Seattle,WA"   Google search will be "Sunrise Seattle,WA" etc.
#   location="Bangladesh"   Google search will be "Sunset Bangladesh" etc.
#   location=""             Google search will be "Sunset" etc.
# Note: Must not have any spaces in the location string.
#
# Set this value to either blank ("") or your location. No spaces.
#
location=""


# Difference, in minutes, that you want to perform the startup and shutdown of
# the video stream during any given day. A value of zero would mean exactly on
# time, negative numbers are preceding sunrise or sunset, and positive numbers
# are after sunrise or sunset. For instance, setting startServiceOffset=0
# would mean that the stream will start exactly at sunrise, setting
# startServiceOffset=-30 would mean that the stream will start 30 minutes
# before sunrise, and stopServiceOffset=60 would mean that the stream will
# stop 60 minutes after sunset.
#
# Set these to your desired start and stop offset values.
# 
startServiceOffset=20
stopServiceOffset=-90


# Maximum length, in seconds, that a video streaming segment is allowed to get,
# before the code will attempt to split the video stream into another segment.
# It will do this by bouncing the video stream, if it's been successfully up
# and running for longer than this configured value.
#
# Problems can occur with YouTube video archives if we try to record a stream
# which lasts too long in any given day. The first problem is that the maximum
# length of a YouTube video seems to be about 12 hours (actually, more like
# 11:55 in practice), and so if we livestream for longer than that, the video
# archive for that day will be truncated. The second problem is that there is a
# "processing" phase on YouTube, where the stream is being converted into an
# archive video, and this "processing" takes an unexpectedly long time if the
# video file is too large. So splitting the video during the day, even if it's
# not having any network troubles, is useful to do.
#
# Recommend setting maxVideoLengthSeconds to a value which is slightly less
# than the winter solstice daylight hours in your region, and/or slightly less
# than half of the summer solstice daylight hours. For instance, if the
# shortest day of your year is going to be 8.5 hours, and the longest day of
# your year is going to be about 16 hours, then set maxVideoLengthSeconds to
# something like 6-8 hours. You can also set it for a shorter length, if you
# prefer the day's video to be split up into even smaller segments, however, be
# advised that each split point will cause the video stream to go down for a
# couple of minutes, so don't make this number too small, or else you'll have
# too many moments of downtime during the day.
#
# Set this variable to be the desired maximum video length, recommended to be
# as short as about 4 hours, and as long as about 11 hours.
#
# Some possible values could be:
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=42900    (11 hours and 55 minutes, max recommended)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=39600    (11 hours)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=28800    (8 hours)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=25200    (7 hours)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=21600    (6 hours)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=14400    (4 hours, minimum recommended)
maxVideoLengthSeconds=27600


# Grace period for $maxVideoLengthSeconds (above), in seconds.
#
# This helps prevent a "short segment" at the end of the broadcast day.
#
# If the video is going to be split into smaller sections based on the value of
# $maxVideoLengthSeconds, but the last section is near the end of the broadcast
# day, this allows the video segment to stretch slightly longer than the
# maximum, so that there isn't a "short segment" left behind at the end of the
# day. For example: If you have configured $maxVideoLengthSeconds to six hours,
# and the day is going to be about 13 hours long, then normally you'd get three
# video segments that day: Two segments of six hours in length, and one final
# segment of only one hour in length, before it shuts down for the night. But
# if you set this value to one hour (3600 seconds), then, if it's near the end
# of the day, it will allow the last segment of the day to stretch an
# additional hour, to seven hours total, so you would get a nicer set of two
# video segments that day: A six hour segment followed by a seven hour segment.
# 
# Set this to a comfortable value that is the shortest that you'd want a short
# segment to be. For instance, if you don't mind having a 60-minute video
# archive segment near the end of the broadcast day, but a 45-minute segment
# would bother you, then set this to 3600 seconds (60 minutes).
# 
# The value must be between 0 and (42900 - $maxVideoLengthSeconds). The latter
# is so that this doesn't accidentally make the video longer than 11:55 (the
# YouTube maximum length).
#
# Recommended value: 3600 seconds (one hour).
# 
maxVideoLengthGracePeriod=3600


# If this hourlyQuickBounce flag is set to "true", then the live YouTube video
# stream will be bounced once, quickly, near the top of each hour. This is an
# attempt to work around the audio desynchronization problem described in
# GitHub issue #14. This will cause a very brief skip in the live YouTube
# video stream once per hour, but hopefully will reset the audio/video timing
# synch at the same time, thus keeping the audio and video mostly in synch
# most of the time.
#
# Set this to true to bounce the stream hourly, false to skip the bounce.
#
# Recommended value: true
#
hourlyQuickBounce=false
